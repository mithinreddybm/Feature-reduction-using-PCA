 
Introduction 
 
Real life data has multiple dimensions and ideally each of the dimension corresponds to a characteristic feature of the data point. However, real life data measurement and collection will involve correlated features which are identified for their ease of understanding and measurement. Principle Component Analysis (PCA) is aimed at extracting and selection of features from measurement data with the goal of obtaining a set of features which are orthogonal and along which there is maximal variability

Part-A 
 
In this part, the student needs to perform a correlation analysis of a chosen data set consisting of the scores obtained by a class of students taking a coming set of courses. The matrix of crosscorrelations between scores from different courses is to be computed and its components need to be analyzed and results are required to be interpreted. 
 
 
The work should be documented as follows: 
2.1. Introduction 
2.2. Computation and Visualization of the Correlations 
2.3. Analysis and Interpretation of the Correlations 
2.4. Conclusion 
Part-B 
 
In this part, the student needs to consider the data set studied in Part-A and analyze it by obtaining its principle features using PCA. A complete PCA computation needs to be carried out followed by feature selection based on it. A proper interpretation of the result of the analysis in terms of its reallife application needs to be obtained.
