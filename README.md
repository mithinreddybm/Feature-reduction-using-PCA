 
Introduction 
 
Real life data has multiple dimensions and ideally each of the dimension corresponds to a characteristic feature of the data point. However, real life data measurement and collection will involve correlated features which are identified for their ease of understanding and measurement. Principle Component Analysis (PCA) is aimed at extracting and selection of features from measurement data with the goal of obtaining a set of features which are orthogonal and along which there is maximal variability
